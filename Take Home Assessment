To address the challenges presented in the Ad Tech case study scenario, I would propose the following solution:

Data Ingestion:

Ad Impressions (JSON): We can use Apache Kafka as a messaging system to collect and process ad impressions data in real-time. Kafka can handle high data volumes and provide fault-tolerance and scalability. We can use a Kafka Connect connector to ingest JSON data from various sources into Kafka topics.
Clicks and Conversions (CSV): Similar to ad impressions, we can use Apache Kafka to collect and process click and conversion data in real-time. We can use a Kafka Connect connector to ingest CSV data into Kafka topics.
Bid Requests (Avro): We can use Apache NiFi to collect and process bid request data in real-time. NiFi can handle semi-structured data formats like Avro and provide data routing, transformation, and aggregation capabilities.
Data Processing:

Data Transformation: We can use Apache Spark Streaming to process data in real-time. Spark can handle high data volumes and provide data validation, filtering, and deduplication capabilities. We can use Spark SQL to standardize and enrich the data.
Correlating Ad Impressions with Clicks and Conversions: We can use Apache Spark SQL to join ad impressions, clicks, and conversions data based on user ID and timestamp. This will provide meaningful insights into ad campaign performance.
Data Storage and Query Performance:

Data Storage: We can use Apache Hive as a data warehousing solution to store processed data efficiently. Hive can handle large data volumes and provide fast querying for campaign performance analysis.
Query Optimization: We can use Hive's query optimization techniques like partitioning, bucketing, and indexing to optimize the storage system for analytical queries and aggregations of ad campaign data.
Error Handling and Monitoring:

Error Handling: We can use Apache Flink as a stream processing system to handle data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays. Flink can provide real-time data processing and error handling capabilities.
Monitoring: We can use Apache Superset as a data visualization and monitoring tool to detect data anomalies and discrepancies. Superset can provide real-time alerting mechanisms to address data quality issues promptly.
In summary, our proposed solution involves using Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Hive, Apache Flink, and Apache Superset to address the data processing and analysis needs of AdvertiseX. This solution can provide scalability, fault-tolerance, and real-time data processing capabilities to handle high data volumes generated in real-time and batch modes.
